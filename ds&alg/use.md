# Tuples

- Immutable, but member objects may be mutable
- Useful for fixed data
- faster than the lists
- Sequence type

# Sets

- Store non-duplicate items
- Very fast access vs lists
- Math set ops (union, intersect)
- Sets are unordered

# Dictionaries

- key/value pairs
- Associate array, like java Hashmap
- Dicts are unordered



Useful resources
How important is collaboration in hospitals
The system details
Health care services as business
Collaboration in the hospitals
Having outside physicians, nurses, and managers to offer health services to the patients.
Including Government-assisted Health Facilities in the system.
Having local private physicians on the panel.
Working with the traditional medicines and healers.
How the system will work
Hospitals should allow to be registered in the system
Patients should be directed to the outside physicians for treatment and the followup must be done thoughout the system.
The system should be having the previous disease data models so that a patient with the similar issue can get treatment easily.
The system should work with the laboratories equipments in real time so that the patient can be treated based on the current data.
The system should have the 3-D view that must be projected on the screen for the physicians to have an efficient decision on the current case.  The doctors should be able to interact with the screens, like rotating and zooming for clear seeing.

The benefits of using this project
Reduced queues at the hospital: 
Getting incomes from the patients
Easy track of the diseases for the hospitals through collaboration
Fast treatment when the patients use the previous case models found on the website
collaboration leads to better problem solving, peer learning, shared purpose, and innovative ideas.
How the users will use the system
Multiple stakeholders — whether individuals (including clinicians and non-clinicians), departments, or entire hospitals — come together to share information, identify gaps in performance, and develop solutions to improve care. This process fundamentally relies on transparency. Outcomes, processes, and even expenses are shared throughout the group.
 Hospitals will be able to track performance over time to see what’s working and what’s not.

Parts of the system
Hospitals groups management
Collaborative and informative sessions among the physicians, hospitals,managers, departments,...
Disease tracking(charts and graphs representations)
Specialised labs(that can work with the sytem in the real time)
Private physicians(that can be hired to work on particular cases and can give out some ideas)
Treatment section(where the patients may come to meet with the physicians either through the chat or through the video)
Diseases and treatment suggetions to the system users(looking like articles)
Selling treatment services and suggestions through the system
